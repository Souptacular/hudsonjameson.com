[{"content":"There has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means. I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community.

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #2: Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity by Blocktown, James Todaro, and Joseph Todaro\nAs I said in my #1 choice, this proposal realizes the fact that the Zcash Foundation and the ECC are best suited for managing this funding. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page). If you are an employer make sure that you have a good mental health policy in place like USAA did for those times when your employees are struggling.

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What is an Ethereum core developer?"},{"content":"Intro Ethereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling). It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"history\"\u003eHistory\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1057\"\u003eProgPoW\u003c/a\u003e is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce.

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page).

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What is an Ethereum core developer?"},{"content":"Intro Ethereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling). It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #2: Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity by Blocktown, James Todaro, and Joseph Todaro\nAs I said in my #1 choice, this proposal realizes the fact that the Zcash Foundation and the ECC are best suited for managing this funding. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page). If you are an employer make sure that you have a good mental health policy in place like USAA did for those times when your employees are struggling.

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What is an Ethereum core developer?"},{"content":"Intro Ethereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling). It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page). If you are an employer make sure that you have a good mental health policy in place like USAA did for those times when your employees are struggling.

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page). If you are an employer make sure that you have a good mental health policy in place like USAA did for those times when your employees are struggling. Let\u0026rsquo;s end the stigma of mental illness.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-07-i-have-mental-illnesses/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have mental illnesses.

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What is an Ethereum core developer?"},{"content":"Intro Ethereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling). It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #2: Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity by Blocktown, James Todaro, and Joseph Todaro\nAs I said in my #1 choice, this proposal realizes the fact that the Zcash Foundation and the ECC are best suited for managing this funding. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page).

As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"I Have Mental Illnesses"},{"content":"This past weekend I attended my first Gencon gaming convention. It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;). Note: gasprice is listed in wei.\nParity Suggested setting --gas-floor-target 4712388 --gas-cap 9000000 --gasprice 4000000000\rExplanation --gas-floor-target Amount of gas per block to target when sealing a new block (default: 4700000).\n--gas-cap A cap on how large we will raise the gas limit per block due to transaction volume (default: 6283184).\n--gasprice Minimum amount of Wei per GAS to be paid for a transaction to be accepted for mining. Note: gasprice is listed in wei. Note 2: --gasprice is a \u0026ldquo;Legacy Option\u0026rdquo;\nOther Mining Options Please visit the CLI options pages for geth and Parity to see the full list of options miners can set to optimally adjust their settings.\nResources and Further Reading Eth Gas Station website with Ethereum gas and miner stats.

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check.

Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #2: Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity by Blocktown, James Todaro, and Joseph Todaro\nAs I said in my #1 choice, this proposal realizes the fact that the Zcash Foundation and the ECC are best suited for managing this funding. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have healthcare or money know that there are options that are low cost or free in most places.\nIf you message me I would be happy to look for those options with you and talk with you about mental health (see the Contact page).

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Gencon, Blockchains, and the One Shot Podcast Network"},{"content":"I was inspired by Zooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s blog posts that detail why he is advising Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Tezos to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\nI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team. This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;).

I\u0026rsquo;m intimately involved in day-to-day operations involving Ethereum 1.0 protocol development as a developer liaison for the community and have been operating the Ethereum Core Developer call (a.k.a AllCoreDevs call) every other Friday since late 2016. The following is not definitive and only represents my opinion. Nothing in this blog represents the opinion of any of my employers or the Ethereum Foundation.\nHistory Reference to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core team\u0026rdquo; can be found in this July 2014 Reddit AMA thread from the early Ethereum team. In the thread, the Ethereum team added flair to their name that said \u0026ldquo;Ethereum core team\u0026rdquo;. In late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the Gitter channel \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; where Ethereum core developers would coordinate development of the protocol. It was in this channel that the first Ethereum Core Developer calls were organized. I expand on the history of the \u0026ldquo;AllCoreDevs\u0026rdquo; meetings in my previous blog post \u0026ldquo;Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination\u0026rdquo;.\nDefinition Ethereum core developers are people who currently provide significant contributions to Ethereum low-level protocol development. One example of a significant contribution is having multiple code commits to Ethereum software at the layers below the Dapp layer, such as client code. Another example is someone who is writing protocol specifications for Ethereum 2.0. I mention the word \u0026ldquo;currently\u0026rdquo; in the definition because core dev isn\u0026rsquo;t a title that you are bestowed and is permanent. If you stop providing contributions then you are considered a former Ethereum core developer. For example: Although Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood made significant contributions to Ethereum early on, he is no longer considered by anyone to be an Ethereum core developer, bur rather a former Ethereum core developer.\nHere is another definition that I wrote years ago that is included in a repository of Ethereum Core Developer meeting notes defining who can attend meetings:\nLow-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally, every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hudson Jameson at hudson@ethereum.org.\nSince I took over the task of running Ethereum Core Developer meetings, I have been responsible for choosing who can attend core developer meetings. The vast majority of those who have requested an invite to the meeting have received one. Deciding who attends a meeting is a very non-controversial process primarily because the meetings are very boring, so unless you take interest in Ethereum 1.0 protocol changes, you won\u0026rsquo;t want to attend. Agendas are publicly published, meetings are live streamed/recorded to YouTube, and notes are taken and published so there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for non-core devs to attend the meetings virtually since they can watch on YouTube or read the notes later.\nWhat about researchers? Currently there are a number of \u0026ldquo;technical ecosystem calls\u0026rdquo;, including the Ethereum Core Developer call, Eth 2.0 call, and Stateless Ethereum calls. People sometimes think that Ethereum core devs are only those who attend Ethereum Core Developer calls, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t accurate. Ethereum 2.0 researchers and others performing important research around topics such as beam sync and stateless Ethereum are also core developers in my opinion. I believe Ethereum 2.0 researchers are called \u0026ldquo;Eth 2 researchers\u0026rdquo; first and \u0026ldquo;core developers\u0026rdquo; second because of the name of the calls and association to them. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to identify core developers and Eth 2.0 researchers by just taking a look at technical ecosystem call attendees rather than commits in a GitHub repository.\nWho decides who is a core dev? No one. There is not a designated person who decides who is a core developer for Ethereum. It is an emergent process decided primarily by contributions and reputation. This line from Jameson Lopp\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog \u0026ldquo;Who Controls Bitcoin Core?\u0026rdquo; describes what defines a Bitcoin core maintainer:\nWho are the Bitcoin Core maintainers? They are contributors who have built up sufficient social capital within the project by making quality contributions over a period of time.\nThis definition also applies to Ethereum core developers.\nCan anyone claim to be a core developer? Technically, no one is stopping anyone from claiming to be a core developer for Ethereum. Anyone is able to contribute to Ethereum protocol development (although their contributions may or may not be accepted). We really haven\u0026rsquo;t had a major problem with \u0026ldquo;imposter core devs\u0026rdquo; in the Ethereum community. If it did start to happen, I guess it would be up to the community to call out people. Even so, at the end of the day it is only a title so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people ask that someone have the title of core dev stripped away because of their opinions or actions within the community. Since the title is not designated by anyone, the Ethereum community is completely within their right to declare someone to not be a core developer. This would not take away anyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the Ethereum protocol and it would not mean that person can no longer attend Core Developer meetings. It would simply demonstrate that the Ethereum community has decided that someone shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given a title. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet as far as I can tell.\nWho are the Ethereum core developers/teams? There are too many people and teams developing across the Ethereum protocol to name them all. Additionally, there are some people who may be working on the protocol layer, but do not want the title or to be called out in a blog post. The beauty of Ethereum client development is that, in both Eth 1.0 and 2.0, there are multiple clients being developed in different languages to provide network redundancy. Clients follow a single specification rather than a single client being the specification that others have to follow. Because I am very involved in the Ethereum 1.0 client development ecosystem, I will list the active Ethereum 1.0 clients. This list does not including other important Eth 1.0 teams and groups, such as the testing team and the ConsenSys Quilt R\u0026amp;D team.\ngeth (Go) Nethermind (.NET Core) OpenEthereum (Rust) Trinity (Python) ethereumJS (JavaScript) Besu (Java) Conclusion Labels and titles are important, but should not be taken too seriously. Defining a group of people as core developers is helpful to know who to talk to when you have a question about Ethereum protocol layer development. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too hung up on who is or isn\u0026rsquo;t an Ethereum core developer because at the end of the day it is a title granted through reputation based on contributions to Ethereum and you can\u0026rsquo;t take those contributions away.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Ethereum protocol development please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I would be happy to connect you to the right people to get you started.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-06-22-what-is-an-ethereum-core-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of debate around what makes someone an Ethereum core developer or what the term even means.

It is being released in at least 3 \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;, labeled Phase 0 through Phase 2. It is anticipated that during Q3-Q4 of 2020 it will be launching Phase 0 of the upgrade that will deploy the \u0026ldquo;beacon chain\u0026rdquo;. The beacon chain, among other things, is meant to act as a coordinator between the different actors participating to secure the Eth 2.0 network. I wanted to join an Eth 2.0 Phase 0 testnet to help and get experience running a node. This article is going to detail the hardware and software set-up I went through to become an Eth 2.0 validator on the Topaz testnet.\nWhat is Topaz and DAppnode? There are multiple Eth 2.0 client implementations and testnets, but the most popular Eth 2.0 testnet currently is called Topaz from Prysmatic Labs running on their Prysm client. DAppnode is the name of a company that sells pre-built computers loaded with their DAppnode operating system software. Their OS software is free and open-source so anyone can take it and install it on their own hardware, provided it is compatible.\nChoosing the Hardware Prysmatic Labs made a blog post announcing the Topaz testnet and listing system requirements.\nI wanted to do more than just run a Prysm validator on the node because DAppnode had a lot of \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo;, such as Eth 1.0 clients and Zcash, that I could install in addition to the Eth 2.0 client. I would probably need a mid-range machine with a lot of hard drive space (for the blockchains I would be running on them) to accomplish this. I wanted a machine that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of noise and I had never owned a fanless PC before so I decided to give that a try. I bought:\n1 x SanDisk SSD PLUS 2TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s, 2.5\u0026#34;/7mm, Up to 535 MB/s - SDSSDA-2T00-G26\r1 x CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2666 C18 Laptop Memory Kit\r1 x 4K Fanless Mini PC, Intel Quad Core I7 8565U,(Black),[HUNSN BM14],[WiFi/1DP/1HDMI/4USB3.0/4USB2.0/1LAN](Barebone System) The solid state drive (SSD) was $219.99, the RAM was $82.99, and the processor/case/motherboard/power supply combo was $409.99. All together the price of the entire system came to $712.97‬ before tax. On reflection, I probably could have saved money buying an i5 processor instead of an i7 and buying 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly the computing requirements of the other DAppnode packages. I imagine you could easily bring this price down to under $500.\nThe reasons I chose to buy a \u0026ldquo;barebones\u0026rdquo; mini-PC is that it generally is cheaper to buy the RAM and hard drive separately and put it together yourself. This was absolutely the case in my situation. When buying the hard drive for an Eth 2.0 validator (or even an Eth 1.0 client) it is important to get a solid state drive, either a classic 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives or the newer internal NVME SSD chips. Both the 2.5\u0026quot; SATA drives and NVME chips were similarly priced, but I was unfamiliar with the NVME chips so I went with the 2.5\u0026quot; drive. I regret this because I learned later than the NVME chips performed better comparatively. Another lesson learned: A fanless system can get VERY HOT. It actually scares me how hot it gets sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will overheat, or worse, catch fire, lol. Have plans in place to add more fans or thermal paste or something if this happens.\nBuilding I opened the case to reveal a tight-fitting area with a small ITX motherboard and the room for a single 2.5\u0026quot; SSD. I attached the hard drive, plugged in the SATA cables to the drive, and popped in the RAM. It was really straightforward, but I can imagine it may be difficult for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have experience building computers. There are many guides online on how to accomplish custom PC building if you decide to take this path and need help.\nInstalling DAppnode OS I followed the instructions on DAppnode installation guide GitHub page, using the Etcher USB writing program to copy the DAppnode ISO file to a USB. That USB was then inserted into the new mini-PC and the computer detected it when it turned on.\nThe steps to installing DAppnode were very smooth overall. Here are a few things I wanted to point out about my DAppnode OS installation experience:\nWhen configuring your disk partitioning, the option to encrypt your disk will come up. Full disk encryption means that your entire system is encrypted so if someone breaks into your house and steals the hard drive from your machine, they cannot get any of the files without first entering a master password. This sounds great, but there are trade-offs. Namely there is a performance hit you take when enabling full disk encryption. This is because files need to be decrypted when they are being read. This is not ideal for software like Ethereum clients because block reads happen a lot. This concern may no longer be relevant because of how far hardware has come along (and someone please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m incorrect), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk it. Additionally, if your computer loses power and restarts, it will require a password on boot-up which is annoying and costly because you lose money when your validator is offline. I want my system to auto-restart when a power outage happens. I chose not to encrypt the disk, but am very curious to hear any comments from my readers about this. After I entered all of the required information throughout the installation and the operating system was fully installed, the machine restarted and allowed me to log-in to a command line interface and run a command to get OpenVPN credentials. The credentials never generated. I tried everything I could think of and finally decided to dig into the system to see what was up. It turns out that even though I successfully logged into my wi-fi network during installation, the credentials had not stuck. I was not connecting to any network at all. The next bullet point talks about how I worked with their support team on this. DAppnode has a very responsive support team that has a chat room on Telegram and Riot (they are bridged together). I asked about the issue I was having and they were quick to respond. They recommended that I plug it in with an ethernet cable rather than rely on wi-fi at all. I am fortunate that I have a monitor near my wireless router and switch so I could do that to finish the installation. DAppnode doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to be physically at the machine and have it connected to a monitor once you finish installing it. It uses OpenVPN to create a virtual connection to the machine. You can install OpenVPN on a separate computer, like a laptop, and log in to your DAppnode\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN tunnel to see the DAppnode interface. Installing Packages This section is going to be light because of how easy it is to use DAppnode. When you load your DAppnode it shows you a slew of software you can choose to install on your machine. I chose to install the Nethermind Ethereum 1.0 client, the Prysm Eth 2.0 validator client for Topaz, and the Prysm Slasher client for Topaz.\nI later installed the Eth2stats Client so my Topaz validator could get a shiny new name and be listed on the Eth2stats validator dashboard.\nHow to Monitor Your Validator Node I monitor my validator node using Beaconcha.in by Bitfly and Etherscan.io Beacon Chain explorer. It is also listed on the Eth2stats.io Topaz Dashboard as Hudson's Fun Node.\nConclusion I plan on running some mainnet staking infrastructure at home and felt participating in the Topaz network was a necessary first step to get my feet wet. When Eth 2.0 Phase 0 launches, I will need to up my game when it comes to building out a robust system that can withstand power and internet outages. Having your validator node go offline is costly if it happens for extended periods of time. I need to buy a new battery backup and create a way for my network connection to failover to a cellular internet connection if my main internet line goes down. Some of this may be overkill, or cost more than the damage that would be done by a short term power/internet outage, but I find it very fun to plan, prepare, and build for these types of scenarios!\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-05-18-eth-2-0-staking-and-more-with-topaz-and-dappnode-for-under-750/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that will bring with it proof-of-stake (to provide more security) and sharding (to provide more scaling).

There is a rich history in how Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decision making processes have developed over time. This article will focus on Eth 1.0 governance and not touch on Ethereum 2.0 governance. This article does not represent the viewpoint of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity that I am associated with.\nMajor Components of Ethereum’s Governance Structure Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Martin Becze, an early Ethereum core developer, created the GitHub repository for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on October 2015. The EIP process is based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process which is based on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) process. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\nThere are different types of EIPs including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade and ERCs for community standards. The most famous EIP is the ERC-20 token standard which is used to create custom tokens on Ethereum.\nEIP editors are tasked with reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and a few others were the original EIP editors from 2015-late 2016. I took over as the primary EIP editor immediately after the Devcon2 Ethereum conference in October 2016 and over time more editors were added/removed. The current EIP editors are myself, Nick Johnson (ENS), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Casey Detrio (EWASM/Ethereum Foundation), Nick Savers (Community), and Greg Colvin (former Ethereum Foundation). An EIP enters “Draft” status as long as the EIP is correctly formatted and the content makes sense. I like to say that an EIP on how to make a proper peanut butter sandwich can be put in draft status as long as it follows the rules outlined in EIP-1 which is the rulebook for creating an EIP. The process of how an EIP comes to consensus and is declared “Final” status is purposefully left vague to encourage community collaboration around the specifications built and implemented. Just because an EIP is not in “Final” status doesn’t mean that standards defined in the EIP cannot be used in projects. In fact that is the correct path an EIP should go down to garner acceptance.\nStarting in January 2020, the EIPIP (EIP Improvement Process) group formed. The goal of this group is for community members to come together in chat rooms, a bi-weekly video conference meeting, and forums, such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum, to make plans to improve the EIP process. The bi-weekly meetings are recorded/uploaded to YouTube and notes are taken. Some of the improvements targeted will include how to attract new EIP editors and the way EIP editors become inducted. Other improvements will involve the EIP process itself and how to streamline it.\nFellowship of Ethereum Magicians The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded in February 2018 by Ethereum Foundation community liaison James Pitts and “Ethereum’s Gandalf” Greg Colvin. It’s mission is “to nurture community consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum”. Some people have described FEM as the IEEE of Ethereum, but it has a much more decentralized, community focused bend to it. It’s online discussion forum serves as the primary place for discussion around EIPs and technical standards in Ethereum. FEM has gatherings at most major Ethereum events where working groups called “rings” are formed. Anyone in the community can create a ring and organize volunteers to solve projects identified by the ring. You can see a list of the rings on the FEM forum.\nThe “All Core Developers” Calls Beginning sometime in late 2015, Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood created the AllCoreDevs Gitter channel to include Ethereum core developers. At the time there were only a handful of Ethereum core developers across a few clients. Martin Becze organized the first few core developer meetings. George Hallam, the PR/communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation 2015-2016, also helped organize a few. In October 2016 I took over the task of organizing, moderating, and writing notes for the meetings. In 2019, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh) joined to assist in facilitating meetings and writing notes. Today others, such as Tim Beiko (Consensys/Pegasys) and James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), are helping with streaming and moderating meetings. Currently the Ethereum Cat Herders funds the core developer meetings notes.\nThe All Core Devs meeting is a technical meeting intended to bring together various Ethereum teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. Ethereum client and research teams provide updates to their projects, and discuss various core EIPs to improve the protocol.\nThe attendees of the meeting include low-level protocol developers, client developers, and core Ethereum researchers. Generally every Ethereum client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. The meetings are bi-weekly on Fridays and are live streamed/recorded on YouTube. You can view the agenda, notes, and videos of previous meetings at this link. You can view upcoming agendas for future meetings at this link.\nThe All Core Devs meetings are a primary tenet of the governance process of Ethereum. It is at these meetings where details behind network upgrades are decided and improvements to the Ethereum 1.0 stack are planned. As much as possible we try to attain rough consensus on decisions that need to be made and avoid voting. Because we design the meetings to be purely technical in nature, it makes it easier for arguments to be resolved by producing design docs, specs, and implementations to support your argument.\nEthereum Cat Herders The Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) group was founded in January 2019 by myself, Lane Rettig (SpaceMesh), and Afri Schoedon (former Parity) because there was a lack of organization and project management in many aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. “Our aim is to bring the minimum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward”. In the beginning ECH primarily helped by funding note taking at All Core Developer meetings and playing a major role in organizing and fundraising for the ProgPoW audits requested by the Ethereum core developers. More recently ECH has helped organizations prepare for upcoming network upgrades (hard forks) including Istanbul and Muir Glacier. As the upgrades approached, ECH reached out to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure providers to point them to blog posts with information and upgrade instructions. ECH releases weekly updates on their Medium blog and recently released a post outlining their accomplishments over the past year.\nNetwork Upgrades Determining what goes into a network upgrade Back when the protocol was young, changes to the Ethereum clients and specification would be quickly decided by a group of under 15 core developers. This worked fine because they were the only experts and figures like Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood acted as benevolent dictators of sorts. That is how it is in many early projects and that is okay. In fact it is needed and helps speed up development.\nThe growth of Ethereum brought with it challenges. Major decisions took longer to debate and more people got involved. That is great! We want contributions and rigor when making changes to such an important technology. Ethereum does not have an on-chain governance mechanism like other blockchain protocols. Major decisions about what goes into an upgrade at the client/protocol level is, at the end of the day, decided by the core developers. It can be argued that Ethereum is operated as a technocracy, but that isn’t the whole story. There are a lot of nuances that make Ethereum’s decision making processes effective.\nMy opinion is that the Ethereum core developers are altruistic and try their best to listen to community feedback when considering what is included in network upgrades. This is entirely based on personal experience and I may just be a naive optimist when it comes to gauging the situation. The alternatives to our current system, like on-chain governance mechanisms, are not appealing to me as they generally result in plutocracies being formed. We will never reach a perfect model for how decisions should be made in a decentralized manner and as time goes on the platform matures along with the governance processes.\nImproving the process Any developer who has an idea to improve the network can submit an EIP. Before late 2019 EIPs had a messy process that made it difficult to navigate the path from idea to full implementation into the protocol. After an EIP was created EIPs would take one of several avenues. The following steps would be conducted (in no specific order):\nAn EIP would be debated outside of the All Core Devs meeting. The EIP would be debated in the All Core Developer meetings. A decision would be made to implement the EIP. More discussion would happen. Test cases would be created The code would be fully implemented across clients. Sometimes an EIP would quickly go from idea to implementation if it was trivial and non-controversial. Other times an EIP would go from idea, to months of debate, to implementation, then more debate, then test cases, then back to debate, then finally making its way into a network upgrade. EIPs with an implementation in a client would get more exposure and acceptance compared to ideas that did not have code behind them. A planned network upgrade that did not involve an emergency situation would bundle a group of EIPs. The image below describes the process I outlined.\nIn 2019 there was much ideation of process improvements for decision making around network upgrades. We realized that network upgrades would happen very infrequently, deadlines we would make for ourselves would constantly be missed, and we lacked the human resources to handle all of the tasks around planning and executing hard forks. In late 2019 James Hancock was hired to be the hard fork coordinator responsible for helping overhaul the decision making process and make sure we execute on our plans. Iterations of different strategies led to what we are calling the “EIP Centric Model\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; of network upgrades. Rather than fumbling around trying to rush EIPs through the process without a set order of operations, EIPs would go through a series of easy to understand steps and network upgrades would be scheduled based on when an EIP is completed. Although this would cause more frequent network upgrades, our processes for communicating with ecosystem players are improving which would help mitigate negative side effects.\nThe diagram above shows the new way EIPs will be moved through the process and eventually end up on mainnet (image courtesy of James Hancock). We began implementing pieces of this process in late 2019 and plan to continue to improve the process into 2020 as we find out what works and what doesn’t.\nCommunicating network upgrades Network upgrades have become both more difficult and less difficult to coordinate. When Ethereum was smaller with less clients and less notoriety, the mining pools, exchanges, and infrastructure providers supporting Ethereum could easily be informed of network upgrades and security vulnerabilities via a few public chat channels on Skype and IRC or what many considered (and still consider) to be a definitive source of truth, the ethereum.org blog.\nThe blog is still used to provide updates about the ecosystem and network upgrades, but there is a concerted effort, both inside and outside of the Ethereum Foundation, to move away from the ethereum.org blog as the primary information outlet for network upgrade announcements. The Ethereum Cat Herders have been writing blog posts that announce and explain Ethereum network upgrades. It is vital for the future of Ethereum to transfer responsibility for these things from the Ethereum Foundation to the community.\nAs Ethereum grew and evolved so did the avenues to spread information on important upgrades and security announcements. Between 2015 and 2018 the primary way that major ecosystem players were notified of major announcements was either the blog or via chat channels. I was one of the 4 people between those years who were responsible for notifying groups of important announcements. During these times we would have about 15 chat rooms from Skype, Slack, and Gitter windows open in order to communicate with important ecosystem participants, manually letting them know the latest versions of Ethereum clients to install to stay secure and up to date. Once the Cat Herders were formed in 2019, we started to transfer those responsibilities to 10+ people who would divide the work of contacting different miners, exchanges, and infrastructure providers. This is the way it needs to be in order to better decentralize responsibilities and to not put a few individuals in a position of power that can be abused.\nWhere we are today Bottom line: Although the Ethereum Foundation and figureheads, like Vitalik, played a significant role in Ethereum’s trajectory early on, the community is taking up the torch to decentralize processes. Decision making processes in Ethereum have matured significantly as the network has grown. We have a long way to go, but given the fact that we are about 5 years old as a community, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic and realizing we cannot build a completely optimal decision making and coordination system overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will discuss how protocol level development decisions are made as well as how Ethereum network upgrades (a.k.a hard forks) are organized.

This post explains the history of ProgPoW, the various arguments for and against it, and my personal opinion on the topic. I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity.\nHistory ProgPoW is \u0026ldquo;a new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs\u0026rdquo;. ProgPoW aims to decrease the economic incentive to build an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); a highly specialized device designed for a specific purpose, in this case, mining Ethereum much more efficiently than traditional GPU mining. ProgPoW is not designed to completely prevent a ProgPoW ASIC from being created, but rather make it expensive to build and not worth it to produce. It was submitted as a core EIP on May 2, 2018, by a semi-anonymous group calling itself IfDefElse.\nIfDefElse and Kristy-Leigh Minehan IfDefElse is a group of 3 or more developers who designed and developed ProgPoW. The only public member of IfDefElse is Kristy-Leigh Minehan (a.k.a OhGodAGirl or Miss If), who has publicly represented ProgPoW at core dev meetings (along with Dev and Else) and has spoken about ProgPoW on podcasts and at Devcon4, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s largest yearly gathering.\nThe EIP Process and Ethereum Core Developer meetings An EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. Depending on the type of EIP, a process is defined that brings an EIP from draft status to Accepted/Final status. EIPs that require a consensus change are defined as Core EIPs. Core EIPs are discussed and decided on during Ethereum Core Developer Meetings that happens every 2 weeks on Fridays. The meetings are live-streamed and published on YouTube, and meeting transcripts are taken. The transcripts and video links can be viewed here.\nMy role since late 2016 has been to organize and run the core developer meetings (along with the help of others). I consider myself a liaison between the community and the core developers as well as a communicator whose responsibility it is to make sure both sides are made aware of sentiment from the other side. Over time we have worked to add more roles so we can better organize the process and make it more open. I used to be both the facilitator of the meetings and a hard fork coordinator. We now have a dedicated hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, and the Ethereum Cat Herders who take notes and perform other tasks needed for the meetings to go smoothly.\nProgPoW and the Ethereum core developer meetings The earliest mention of ProgPoW I could find in an Ethereum core developer meeting is meeting #38 which occurred on May 18, 2018. There have been off and on discussions about ProgPoW during core developer meetings since that time. Below I have a list of the 13 meetings where ProgPoW was mentioned.\n#38 - May 18, 2018\n#45 - August 24, 2018\n#47 - September 28, 2018\n#52 - January 4, 2019\n#53 - January 18, 2019\n#54 - February 1, 2019\n#57 - March 15, 2019\n#62 - May 24, 2019\n#65 - July 18, 2019\n#74 - November 1, 2019\n#77 - December 13, 2019\n#79 - January 24, 2020\n#81 - February 21, 2020\nProgPoW as a bargaining chip to miners Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction EIPs at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up often. Some considered it a \u0026ldquo;bargaining chip\u0026rdquo; for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners still believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a network upgrade in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality, it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent possible, but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386\nProgPoW Accepted EIP-1 defines the Accepted state of a Core EIP as \u0026ldquo;status signals that material changes are unlikely and Ethereum client developers should consider this EIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process\u0026rdquo;. This is different from Final status which is when a core EIP has been implemented and deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in a network upgrade.\nSometime around or before December 2018, core developer Martin Swende, along with others, built and deployed the Gangnam testnet which tested how the transition from Ethash to ProgPoW would work, among other insights. It proved to be successful in showing that ProgPoW would not break the network and the code that IfDefElse contributed to the Geth client worked (with some tweaks by the Geth team).\nProgPow was \u0026ldquo;tentatively accepted pending an audit\u0026rdquo; during meeting #52 (January 4, 2019). The decision to move forward with ProgPoW was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence, which is not ideal. To be clear, some core devs were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time, so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. That is how I feel the silence was justified: ProgPoW was a worn-out subject to discuss. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise, we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is:\nSo not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we\u0026rsquo;ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go-ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we\u0026rsquo;re going ahead with it unless there\u0026rsquo;s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that\u0026rsquo;s not the case or if there\u0026rsquo;s different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW. (From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099)\nIn a later meeting (#54 - February 1, 2019), it was decided that:\nThe community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is conducting a 3rd party audit. Miners should start vote signaling using the extraData field. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision. There was skepticism from some of the core developers that this audit would not quell the concerns from the community and that this would remain a controversial EIP.\nAt the time this was happening I had personal life events going on, so I did not communicate this to the community as I would normally do through tweets and Reddit. In late March 2019, there was surprise by some community members that these decisions had seemingly been made without alerting the community. I addressed this and some other misconstrued aspects of the ProgPoW debate in this Reddit post that I also posted on Twitter.\nThe Ethereum Cat Herders get to work On February 1, 2019, during Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #54 it was decided that the Ethereum Cat Herders would raise funds for and organize an audit for ProgPoW as well as perform community sentiment analysis. The purpose of the audit (which then turned into audits from two separate entities) was to evaluate the hardware claims made by the ProgPoW team as well as look for flaws/negative effects in the ProgPoW software implementation. More details and the result of the sentiment analysis are located in this Medium article.\nSentiment analysis from early 2019 Sentiment analysis of the community around ProgPoW was released in late March 2019. Gauging sentiment in a decentralized ecosystem with many different participants is very difficult. For our collection, we chose a few different types of signals to measure: Surveys/interviews, coin voting, and miner voting.\nThe sentiment collected at the time revealed that there was, arguably, overwhelming support for ProgPoW from those surveyed and those who participated in coin/miner voting. This is a very imperfect sentiment collection. The coin vote revealed 184,528 NO votes vs 2,936,072 YES votes, overwhelmingly in favor of ProgPoW. However, coin votes are susceptible to vote-buying and it is difficult to get community members to participate. Unless I strongly care about ProgPoW, why would I pull my coins out of cold storage? Surveys that were conducted by the Ethereum Cat Herders did not reveal the affiliations of those surveyed so there could have easily been biases. Miner voting was the most telling result of this sentiment collection. 77.2% of miners participated in the polling by indicating their position in the extraData field of mined blocks. Of that 77.2% of miners who decided to participate, 100% of them were pro-ProgPoW. In other words, there was not a single “No” vote in any mined blocks. While the voting has already concluded, some miners are still signaling “Yes”, as shown in this recent block (see “PPYE” in the “extraData” field). There is an argument to be made that it would be stupid for ASICs on the network to vote in this poll because it would reveal that they are ASICs and show what percentage of the hash rate is made up of ASICs.\nIt is very easy to discount signals that one does not personally agree with on either side of the argument. This is done by pointing out flaws in the signal itself and calling into question it’s legitimacy. Without a social contract to fall back on, resolving disagreements through signaling can become intractable.\nProgPoW software and hardware audits The audits were released in September 2019. The delay in the audit\u0026rsquo;s release was primarily due to issues raising funds. Least Authority, a well known security consulting group in the cryptocurrency space, performed the software audit and the hardware audit was performed by Bob Rao, a distinguished former Intel Fellow responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. The links to the audits are located here.\nThe main concern raised by the Least Authority audit was the modified design of the Keccak function in the algorithm. This Twitter thread elaborates on how it isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal to the IfDefElse team and this Twitter thread provides even more context. It is something that may need to be further investigated, but I find IfDefElse\u0026rsquo;s response sufficient and don\u0026rsquo;t consider it an issue. Another finding from the Least Authority audit was that both Ethash and ProgPoW were susceptible to what they called \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Method Mining Attack\u0026rdquo;. We will talk more about this in the pros and cons section of this article.\nPost audit decisions from the core developers After the audit was released, the core developers were too preoccupied with the upcoming Istanbul network upgrade to focus on ProgPoW. Others will posit that it was avoided as a topic, and I somewhat agree with that as well. I believe the core developers were tired of talking about it and were waiting for someone to take aggressive action to make a plan to enact it. It should be noted that there was community discussion around ProgPoW at this time, but it was quickly buried within 1-2 weeks by other Ethereum news/events.\nDuring meeting #74 on November 1, 2019 ProgPoW was brought up again. This time it was in response to a question on whether it was EFI (Eligible for Inclusion) or not. EFI is a state where a Core EIP is decided to be a good idea and given the go ahead by core developers to further investigate, code, and/or fund the EIP. The reason for enacting the EFI process in mid-2019 is for cases where people were worried about spending time and money on an EIP to eventually get a strong no from core developers who could have indicated their dissatisfaction with the idea earlier.\nProgPoW was officially put in EFI state during meeting #77 on December 13, 2019.\nRecent Developments The ProgPoW debates were resurrected in February 2020 after it was brought up during meeting #81 on February 21, 2020. Discussion around the following points was had:\nWe have a proposal for a network upgrade for the BLS precompile which would be called Berlin. Then, the next 3rd Wednesday of the following month we would have a fork that includes only ProgPoW. The reason for this is so people who are not in favor of ProgPoW cannot claim that it is being snuck in to a network upgrade with other EIPs (in my opinion). Note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is final and is still up for debate. Some people on the core developer call were concerned about community sentiment being anti-ProgPoW. In the opinion of myself and hard fork coordinator James Hancock (at the time) the chance of a network fork due to ProgPoW was small. We discussed whether or not there is a better venue than Hudson\u0026rsquo;s personal Twitter to spread the news of ProgPoW going live on a specific date. The Ethereum.org blog was brought up as a possibility, but my rebuttal was: There are trade-offs to doing that, and when I say that what I mean is: it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s an endorsement by the EF (Ethereum Foundation), which it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The Geth team, though funded by the EF, has autonomy with regards to these types of decisions. No one outside the Geth team influences — or has ever influenced — any decision for what goes into a network upgrade.\nJames Hancock endeavored to hear everyone\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and grievances as a part of his role as hard fork coordinator and requested that anyone with opinions come to him. It was decided a blog post on the Ethereum.org blog should go out sooner than other network upgrade blog posts have gone out in the past to make sure everyone is aware of the ProgPoW decision. I stated the following about inviting prominent ProgPoW detractors to the call: Artem makes a good point that we should definitely invite Stefan and Martin K. [from Gnosis/open-ethereum] if they want to come on and give their perspective of why they would like that they\u0026rsquo;re splitting just so people are aware. I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to Martin K. just to see what his position is now. I think he knows anyway if he wants to [come on the call], but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create drama for the sake of drama so I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding that as much as possible, while still making sure people are aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on and giving them voice. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to balance and I think James is doing a good job of that and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to also do a good job with that.\nThere have been rabid debates on Twitter and from all angles of the community. There is a draft of \u0026ldquo;EIP-2538: Information Position Statement Against Activation of ProgPoW\u0026rdquo; which included a list of signatures of those who dissented to ProgPoW\u0026rsquo;s inclusion in Ethereum. There was then an anonymous letter to the Core Devs from a \u0026ldquo;committed investor, miner, and supporter of Ethereum\u0026rdquo; about ProgPoW expressing support for ProgPoW.\nArguments: Pros and cons I have been collecting arguments for and against ProgPoW, as well as reading the Kialo ProgPoW discussion site. These arguments do not reflect my personal views, but have been collected to lay out both sides of the discussion as best I can. Notably, I left out anything I believe to be a conspiracy theory.\nPros Motivation (PM#) PM1. Ethereum was designed to be ASIC resistant according to the White Paper and Yellow Paper (pg. 13-14).\nRebuttal: Although ASIC resistance was the original goal of Ethereum times have changed and it is very difficult to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Additionally, other algorithms that are less controversial than ProgPoW need to be explored, such as SHA3.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: See Argument CT3.\nPM2. ProgPoW improves Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s decentralization because commodity GPUs from individuals have a chance to mine rather than a few large corporations. It effectively decentralizes hash rate.\nRebuttal: This argument assumes that ASICs will not be sold to the average person, which previous evidence disproves(see the Antminer E3). Rebuttal to the rebuttal: Access to cheap electricity drives the decision to mine and decentralization. The average person paying 13 cents per KWh using an E3 Ethash ASIC is no match to a miner paying 1 cent per KWh with RX580 GPU card.\nPM3. The mining community, made up largely of individual miners/hobbyists, have supported Ethereum since the beginning and their wishes, as indicated by the miner vote, should be respected.\nRebuttal: Miners are service providers who secure the network for a reward. Although they are a part of the community, they should not be the only community stakeholder listened to in this debate. Miners vote can only be counted in hashrate, it is not possible to distinguish between individual miners with low hashrate and one single miner controlling many workers.\nPM4. If ASICs proliferate the network (especially if it is only 1-2 entities) they can perform attacks, such as double-spending. They have this incentive because of the move to PoS.\nRebuttal: The current GPU miners are not provably altruistic so they have the same incentive to disrupt the network. They are profit-motivated and their actions in the ecosystem do not necessarily reflect how they are going to act as Eth 2.0 approaches. Ethereum’s difficulty bomb makes it difficult for any miner to disrupt the move to PoS because they would need to fork the chain and remove the bomb to create a profitable chain once the bomb goes off.\nPM5. The identities of the top Ethereum GPU mining pools are known. As ASICs proliferate the network, it will push GPU mining pools out because it will be unprofitable until 1-2 large ASIC entities control most of the network. If a secret ASIC is developed, we will not be able to hold accountable the entity that may attack the network or, at minimum, gain 51% of the has rate to threaten an attack.\nRebuttal: Since the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack is a known exploit in Ethash, ASIC manufacturers have an even playing field as far as being able to produce a performant ASIC. Competition among ASIC companies will ensue, similar to Bitcoin, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Memory-hard ASIC\u0026rsquo;s that are able to perform the light-evaluation behavior require the company creating the ASICs to have advanced knowledge of memory controllers or open-source memory controllers, which puts some ASIC companies at an advantage.\nPM6. The current GPU mining pools are supportive of the Eth 2.0 transition and will not attack the network. This is shown by the work Sparkpool has done for the Ethereum community and the work on Eth 2.0 Bitfly/Etherchain has done. If there is an unaccounted for ASIC that secretly takes a large amount of hashing power we are at risk.\nRebuttal: See Rebuttal on PM4.\nPM7. ASICs are very specialized hardware which means that they are subject to licensing and import/export controls and other regulatory hassles by authoritarian governments who may seek to control the mining community or censor transactions on the network.\nRebuttal: There are other means to track mining activity (e.g. electricity bills). Besides, it is a very questionable premise that Ethereum should enable resistance to government regulation.\nPM8. ProgPoW was not controversial when it was introduced. Controversy was directly correlated with certain parties, such as Kristy and IfDefElse, rather than the algorithm itself. This does actually open a threat vector that you can create enough \u0026ldquo;FUD\u0026rdquo; to reject a proposal you disagree with.\nRebuttal: There have always been questions about ProgPoW. Governance capture works both ways, so if we allow ProgPoW through we are letting bad actors capture the core developer’s interest and are pushing through a proposal with significant opposition from the community.\nTechnical (PT#) PT1. The hardware and software audits both concluded that ProgPoW is a significant improvement over today\u0026rsquo;s Ethash implementation.\nRebuttal: There were a few things pointed out in the audits, including the \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits. The audits also concluded that, although ProgPoW would remove ASICs from the network, advances in hardware may make it possible that GPUs/FPGAs can no longer compete with a ProgPoW ASIC.\nPT2. The \u0026ldquo;Light-Evaluation Mining Attack\u0026rdquo; referenced in both audits needs to be addressed. It allows for a large increase in ASIC efficiency that would effectively push out GPU miners and allow for only a few ASIC companies on the network. This is present in both Ethash and ProgPoW, although it can be fairly easily fixed in ProgPoW. Rebuttal: If a decision is made that this is something to be concerned about we should assess other mining algorithms that may be more ASIC friendly or less ASIC friendly.\nPT3. ProgPoW has been tested using the Gangnam testnet so it is safe to use on the network.\nRebuttal: There is always a risk deploying a change like this, so we have to evaluate if the risk to the network and reasons we want to implement ProgPoW are sufficient to risk the network losing security by relative hash rate dropping or the network breaking if there is a flaw in ProgPoW.\nPT4. There is a lot of evidence that secret ASICs on the Monero network made up over 51% of the hash rate until they were forked off. The same could happen to Ethereum, which would put us at the mercy of a few anonymous ASIC manufacturers.\nRebuttal: See CT1, CT2.\nCons Motivation (CM#) CM1. The community has been ignored in the past as well as today when discussing ProgPoW. It was stealthily (maliciously or not) pushed through the Core Developer meetings without proper input from the community.\nRebuttal: While it is true that the communication with the non-miner community could have been handled better, it does not negate the fact that the reasoning behind ProgPoW still stands and needs to be acted on. It has been thoroughly discussed on the core developer meetings which is shown in the videos/notes of the meetings and community was gauged appropriately with the resources and signaling systems we had.\nCM2. Since ProgPoW is mostly implemented and tested across multiple clients, it can serve as a deterrent for ASICs to be built at a significant scale.\nRebuttal: ASIC proliferation can go undetected for a long time (see Monero\u0026rsquo;s secret ASIC proliferation) and by the time we realize it we will already be under attack by an unknown actor. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\nCM3. Kicking ASICs off the network is discriminating against certain actors that have so far not proven themselves to not be bad actors in their mining support of the network.\nRebuttal: See PM2, PM4.\nCM4. ASIC resistance makes attacks on cryptocurrencies cheaper, primarily for sophisticated and well-resourced attackers like nation-states. From Phil Daian\u0026rsquo;s blog post:\nRebuttal: Ethereum is currently 3% NiceHash attackable. To be at risk of a NiceHash attack the difficulty would need to reduce 90% or more before that attack is even possible. The likelihood that the network is made up of 90% ASICS is low. We can see this soon with the bricking of the original Antminer E3’s. It should be implemented in clients, but commented out, to serve as a deterrent.\n\u0026gt; General-purpose computer-secured systems are cheaper to attack than specialized systems, as general-purpose hardware can be rented and resold after an attack to substantially subsidize attack cost. Worse still, an attacker can use general-purpose hardware advantages to overwhelm any cryptocurrency seeking to avoid specialization by carrying attacks across PoW changing / defensive forks, a feature which is not possible with ASICs, where the community has a “nuclear option” available to disable miners at any time if objectively malicious behavior is detected. These two factors combined severely cripple the economic security of networks secured by general-purpose hardware.\nRebuttal: The threat of large actors like nation-states are not applicable with how small Ethereum, and cryptocurrency in general, still is. They do not pose a big enough threat. Even smaller actors looking to destabilize the network will be stopped by our governance processes.\nCM5. ProgPoW should not be a priority because we need to focus all of our energy on PoS.\nRebuttal: There are very, very little Eth 2.0 developers who have worked on, or even discussed thoroughly, ProgPoW. Eth 1.0 development will eventually merge somewhat with the governance processes and development of Eth 2.0, but as of now, they are separate. Additionally, ProgPoW is nearly implemented in 3 major clients and a custom testnet has been successfully run so there isn\u0026rsquo;t more than a month of work (probably less) to do on it from a development perspective.\nRebuttal to the rebuttal: Contentious hard forks not only involve miners, but also Dapp developers and exchanges who will have to pick a side that can end up defeating the very purpose of making the Eth 2.0 upgrade easier.\nCM6. Most of the people behind the development of ProgPoW are anonymous so we do not know their professional affiliations and potential conflicts of interest.\nRebuttal: Many anonymous developers contribute greatly to the Ethereum ecosystem. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the developers are if the code is technically sound and has no advantage to particular pieces of hardware.\nCM7. ProgPoW is a contentious issue and would likely result in a network split.\nRebuttal: Arguably, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t contentious until the community felt they weren\u0026rsquo;t heard. People listen to influencers and prominent community members so they are influenced by those loudly proclaiming it is contentious. It has become contentious because people say it is contentious.\nTechnical (CT#) CT1. It is no longer feasible to create a mining algorithm that is truly ASIC resistant. An ASIC will always be created. \u0026ldquo;For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It’s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: There are coins, such as Ravencoin and Monero, who are experimenting with ways to create ASIC resistant algorithms to stymie ASICs from joining their mining network that are showing success. RandomX is an example of this.\nCT2. The fears that were experienced about secret ASICs mining the network and pushing GPUs out have been disproven in the 1.5+ years this has been up for debate.\nRebuttal: The secret ASICs mining on Monero was there for over a year before they were detected. It is entirely possible that we will not notice, just like miners and developers did not immediately notice the ice age block time changes until late 2019.\nCT3. The \u0026ldquo;economies of scale\u0026rdquo; argument dictates that \u0026ldquo;a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Miners have a variety of possible ways to gain “edges” over other miners, using even small differences in profitability at scale to dominate (and eventually purchase, if necessary) their competition, potentially centralizing production in an asymmetry of interest or resources.\u0026rdquo;.\nRebuttal: Phil\u0026rsquo;s blog about economies of scale, in addition to David Vorick\u0026rsquo;s blog that references economies of scale assume that the PoW coins are going to indefinitely remain PoW. Ethereum switching to Proof-of-Stake in the \u0026ldquo;near future\u0026rdquo; would deter ASIC manufacturers from spending the time and money creating a ProgPoW ASIC.\nCT4. The DAG size is approaching 4GB so mining with both AMD GPUs with 4GB of memory and the main Ethash ASICs on the network won\u0026rsquo;t be able to mine Ether by the end of the year, and likely much earlier.\nRebuttal: New ASICs can be created that utilize the Light-Evaluation Mining Attack referenced in PT2 to circumvent this.\nCT5. Nvidia funded and co-designed ProgPoW. They have designed it to run better on Nvidia GPUs to compete with AMD.\nRebuttal: The Nvidia funding/co-design of ProgPoW is unfounded with no solid evidence. Although in earlier versions of ProgPoW there was an advantage to mine using Nvidia GPUs this was somewhat fixed in later versions. The reason AMD vs Nvidia GPUs will not have the same performance is because Nvidia GPUs are better designed and more performant compared to AMD GPUs in general. Multiple independent tests were run by the community to confirm this.\nConclusions (biased, personal perspective) Will ProgPoW cause a network split There has been concern that if ProgPoW is included in a network upgrade that there would be a contentious hard fork, like the one that created Ethereum Classic. I have been seeing a few prominent people on Twitter proclaiming that they would support this fork, or at minimum not run a version of Ethereum that includes ProgPoW. I have also seen prominent Ethereum client developers indicate that they want to avoid a fork. I believe that if a fork were to occur it would be a money grab for those who want to take advantage of having coins on both chains, but that the minority chain would fizzle out quickly. With the prominence and money involved in DeFi and other on-chain protocols it would not be in the interest of anyone to support an Ethereum fork long term over a contentious algorithm update that is primarily rallied against because the community was not properly informed or heard. However, this is still not ideal in any way! I don\u0026rsquo;t want a fork.\nThe role of miners in ProgPoW I believe that GPU miners on Ethereum deserve to be heard and are more than just \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo; who are just in it for the profit. I have worked extensively with the operators of the top two mining pools on Ethereum, Ethermine and Sparkpool. Together they currently make up around 51% of network hash power. The operator of Ethermine operates Ethernodes, etherchain.org, PoolWatch.io, and beaconcha.in. They also have been very active in the core dev community helping us during network upgrades and the Geth/Parity (now open-ethereum) teams improve their clients. Sparkpool has done a lot of work for the community, including being integral in helping the network survive the Shanghai Attacks before, during, and after Devcon2 and planning on supporting Eth 2.0 staking services. It is impossible to prove that these entities are altruistic, and game theory suggests that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but I believe that they are and I am confident that they won\u0026rsquo;t attack the network.\nWe are a technocracy The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy since there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. A technocracy is defined as \u0026ldquo;the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts\u0026rdquo;. The core developers decide which core EIPs go into a network upgrade and a vast majority of the time the topics discussed and decided on are too technical for most of the community to be involved in deciding. A few notable exceptions to this are The DAO fork and anytime we have implemented issuance reduction. Eric Connor recently made a great post about this issue as it relates to ProgPoW and his ideas around solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers on how to solve this, but I hope in time we will get better at governance systems that let as many people as possible have a voice.\nWhere does the community stand today? The early 2019 ECH sentiment collection is no longer valid. It has been nearly a year since that sentiment collection occurred and things have changed. The community has come together to loudly show dissent for reasons listed in my pros/cons list.\nMy stance on ProgPoW I have always been in favor of whatever the community wanted and never had strong opinions on if ProgPoW should be implemented or not. I have misjudged community sentiment at various times and this whole debate is one of those times. The primary reason for ProgPoW having such rabid opposition is because the community did not feel heard in this discussion. There were multiple instances of less than stellar communication from myself, other organizers, and core devs. Each side should of course be heard, however, the fate of ProgPoW should have been, ideally, decided on the merits of complex analysis and not dissent alone. Both need to be considered and in this situation community dissent won. That is not to say ProgPoW is flawless on a technical level, but the audits performed suggest that ProgPoW wouldn’t bring down Ethereum on a technical level. In my opinion, ProgPoW isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it and is dead based on overwhelming evidence of community dissent.\nThe community did its job of making sure they were heard, albeit under less than ideal circumstances that should never have happened in the first place. We need to learn how to create better signaling systems and make sure everyone is heard as best we can.\nCivil discussion is needed I have talked to people who have been directly harassed due to this debate. I think this is unacceptable and we should denounce this as a community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if only a few people were \u0026ldquo;provably harassed\u0026rdquo; or if the majority of those harassed were on one side of the debate or the other. We need to have productive, civil discourse as we try to solve difficult governance and communication problems. I believe we can do it.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Artem Vorotnikov, Ben DiFrancesco, Charles St. Louis, Collin Myers, Edson Ayllon, James Hancock, Jerome de Tychey, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, Mariano Conti, Pooja Ranjan, Samuel Dare, and Tim Beiko for taking the time to review and offer suggestions on this article.\nInteresting links related to ProgPoW or mining Kialo collaborative decision making tool site for ProgPoW. \u0026ldquo;Takeaways from the ProgPoW Situation\u0026rdquo; by Eric Connor (@econoar).

I have turned this into a post on the Zcash forums. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board and I take this decision very seriously. I hope the community comes together on this.\nZcash Forum Post Tweet Skip to the bottom for my pick\nWho am I? My name is Hudson Jameson and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast who is involved in both the Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Zcash community. I work for the Ethereum Foundation in a role for devops and community management. I hold a number of roles in the wider Ethereum ecosystem including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) Editor, Reddit moderator, Ethereum Cat Herders group co-founder, and core developer liaison responsible for organizing the bi-weekly Ethereum core developer calls. I am on the Zcash Community Advisory Panel that will be polled (for sentiment collection) by the Zcash Foundation regarding NU4 proposals (dev fund proposals). I care about Zcash and it\u0026rsquo;s community. I consider Ethereum and Zcash besties \u0026lt;3\nPre-Research View Before I started reviewing the ZIPs and community feedback, I wanted to formulate an opinion based only on what I had read so far and personal opinions. I have read or skimmed the following before I really dug into the ZIPs:\nJames Prestwhich\u0026rsquo;s Opinion Piece\nZcash Foundation piece asking for ECC to be non-profit\nECC response to above piece\nBefore I read any of the above, I thought the following should happen:\nCut off rewards to investors and founders\n20% of the block reward should be split between the ECC and Zcash Foundation because they have both done an excellent job being stewards for Zcash\nOnce I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed. I never really personally dug into the logistics of the ECC but had familiarity with their dev work and that they hire top notch folks. After reading the Zcash Foundation article that asks that the ECC become a non-profit I thought that was a neat idea. The ECC response seemed to basically say we need to explore the non-profit route and seemed to attempt to be very politcally nuetral in their messaging in the post.\nWhere I currently land (I wrote this part around August 2019) before diving into the ZIPs is that the Zcash Foundation should get 20% of the block reward and decide if they want to hire organizations like Parity and the ECC for development. The reasons for this are the following:\nThe block reward funding is a unique way to sustain a blockchain protocol\u0026rsquo;s development. The only way to feasibly have one is to launch the blockchain with one. Ethereum recently underwent some block reward funding proposals, but they have faced major disagreements and backlash from community members primarily because there is disagreement of if the money is needed and who decides who gets the money. If you\u0026rsquo;re a blockchain project that starts with a block reward try to retain it.\nThere are no other organizations that are non-profit in the Zcash community that have the infrastructure and reputation to handle the funds.\nStopping the block reward would cause major financial stress to the entities and people who build Zcash. The Ethereum Foundation has a large fund of pre-sale ether and Bitcoin that has allowed them to support the development and education of the Ethereum ecosystem. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a large pre-sale fund that the ECC or Zcash Foundation have.\nEDITED 11/18: I gave my \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo;, but not my \u0026ldquo;Post-Research View\u0026rdquo; as far as letting everyone know my thoughts after doing some more research on the areas in the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Research View\u0026rdquo; (outside of the ZIPs). I said above that \u0026ldquo;Once I read Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece I started to question how well the ECC has been managed.\u0026rdquo; Zooko was kind enough to send me this video that gives a great overview of the ECC. I also talked frankly to Zooko about some of the things brought up in Jame\u0026rsquo;s piece and I am comfortable saying that I believe the ECC is being managed well. No organization is perfect, but the level of transparency provided based on the ECC material I have dug into shows that things are growing and successful.\nOverview of ZIPs Arguments (performed November 13-14, 2019) The following section features some of the arguments I found in ZIPs/discussions and what I think about them.\nZIP proposal Keep the block distribution as initaly defined. 90% to miners This ZIP basically says that the FR should end and miners get 100% of the reward as promised.\nI agree that the FR (Founder\u0026rsquo;s Reward) should end. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard a good argument as to why it should continue. The plan was for the FR to end by this time and it should end. However, the funding situation for Zcash\u0026rsquo;s future is a more complicated topic and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is sustainable for Zcash to not have some sort of block reward funding for development and other functions of a cryptocurrency.\nZIP Proposal - A genuine opt-in protocol level, development donation option This ZIP advocates for an opt-in system where users (miners) decide if they want to donate a portion of their funds (such as mining fees) to ensure the initial promise the ECC made about funding at the start of Zcash is honored.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this. Businesses such as the ECC and Zcash Foundation cannot create business plans and funding roadmaps that are dependent on unreliable funding. As the price of Zcash fluctuates things will change. Maybe the price will become low enough that miners can no longer afford to donate. In that scenario the entities who are benefitting from the donations will suddenly (and likely constantly) have to read just their funding plans.\nDev fund proposal: 20% to any combination of ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or “burn” \u0026ldquo;This proposal reserves a portion (20%) of the newly minted coins in each block for the dev fund. A fixed set of developer entities would be eligible to receive these funds. The fund would be miner directed in the sense that the miner of each block can determine how to allocate these funds to eligible developers.\nDuring the 2nd halvening period, a fixed portion (DF%=20%) of the newly minted coins in each block are reserved for a Miner Directed Dev Fund (MDDF). A hardcoded set of developer entities (e.g., ECC, Zfnd, Parity, or others), represented in the code their t-address or z-address public keys, are eligible to receive funding from the MDDF. The fund is “miner directed” in the sense that the miner in each block chooses how to allocate the MDDF coins among the developer entities, simply by creating outputs in the coinbase transaction. The DF% is a maximum - miners can also “opt out” by minting a lower number of coins for the MDDF, or none at all.\nAfter the 2nd halvening, the entire block reward in each block is awarded to the miner.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom my experience dealing with Ethereum miners upgrading their systems to new versions during network upgrades, I have doubts about the level of miner participation in this proposed system. Many of them will just go with the default settings until it affects their bottom line, at which point they will change it to a setting where they are giving little to no money to a dev fund.\nAs I mentioned in the other opt-in miner proposal, it is difficult for organizations to manage their funding roadmap without guarentees about what they will be taking in funding wise.\nAlthough this could be a sort of \u0026ldquo;training wheels\u0026rdquo; period where the organizations learn to gather funds from other sources, this adds overhead that slows down other functions those orgs could be performing if they are always worried about fundraising or providing services for funds.\nDev Fund Proposal: 20% split between the ECC and the Foundation I think this proposal has some strong, positive qualities I agree with. In the \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; section it states:\n\u0026ldquo;Strengths of this proposal:\nSimple to implement. I would rather developers spend time scaling Zcash rather than implementing the dev funding mechanism.\nDevelopers will have several years to work on a great decentralized development funding voting mechanism.\n20% is a large enough percentage that there should be enough dev funding for many different Zec price scenarios. To those who want to decrease this percentage: Overpaying for security is a gift to miners, to the detriment of every other stakeholder in the Zcash community. I will even make the strong statement that intentionally overpaying the miners for security is stealing from the other stakeholders.\nWith two entities receiving funds there is no single point of failure.\u0026rdquo;\nAll 4 points are valid in my opinion. I really like the point that it aims to keep distractions away from the devs and orgs during the 2nd halvening while giving them enough time to really flesh out a proposal. However, once you get to the specification section things get less cool. The \u0026ldquo;Voting System Requirements\u0026rdquo; includes the lines \u0026ldquo;Voting should be private.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Voting should happen on-chain.\u0026rdquo; I strongly disagree with on-chain voting in general, even with timed lock-ins of ZEC. Too many whales, or organizations like the ECC and Zcash Foundation or any exchange, could anonymously sway the vote and no one would know. This is where transparency trumps privacy.\nOnce you decide that on-chain private voting based on coin voting is ineffective then you start to think about alternatives. What about transparent voting? That would give away addresses of whales and potentially expose their identity or at least their intentions. What about blacklisting large orgs and exchanges? Is that fair to the organizations and how would this prevent organizations from just mixing their coins using the protocol level tools Zcash provides? What about bribing and the sorts of voting cartels we currently see in EOS and Lisk cryptocurrencies? Going down this rabbit hole does no good for this point in the development of blockchains.\nZIP proposal: ZCFS (Zcash Community Funding System) The specification is basically a modification of the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and reminds me somewhat of what Dash does for their on-chain funding mechanism. I think this is a cool idea and if enacted earlier on in the life of Zcash when things were smaller and less was on the line it would be very valuable.\nThe main issue is that this proposal relies on ZEC holders donating to specific causes which requires a level of participation that I doubt the community would be able to handle. Many people keep their ZEC in cold storage or on exchanges. The exchanges and wallets do not have an incentive to provide this type of governance mechanism as a feature of their wallet/exchange. The only participants would be active miners who care about Zcash and are not just mining whatever algorithm is the most profitable at the time and ZEC holders who can easily access their coins to vote if they run their own client. That is an incredibly small percentage of holders.\nIf the precedent of crowdfunding was built into the core protocol early on and into all of the mining and client software, I can see this working very well, but at this point we have to be realistic about the level of participation this would attain.\nBlocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity I already have good feels about this proposal because it tries to tackle the financing mechanim as well as the governance mechanism without an opt-in mechanic. In fact it states that \u0026ldquo;This funding mechanism MUST be hard-coded so that 10% of newly issued ZEC from block rewards are automatically directed to the transparent address(es) of the Zcash Development Fund\u0026rdquo;. The Zcash Foundation, ECC, and a \u0026ldquo;third entity\u0026rdquo; would oversee allocating the 10% dev fund to various individuals and entities. A 2-of-3 multisig would be enacted so 2 out of 3 parties must agree on where the funds go. If there is a disagreement between the ECC and Zcash Foundation with how to proceed with a decision the third entity would become involved.\nI like that the process for forming the third-party entity are not determined in this proposal beyond the very basics of the governance mechanism. It leaves open the opportunity for more community discussion and formation of the group. At the same time, it leaves open the opportunity for the ECC or Zcash Foundation to abuse the system.\nEDIT 11/18: On a Zcash forum post I was alerted to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;at current ZEC prices the 10% total dev funding in the Blocktown proposal would not allow ECC to continue in their current operations as they are today\u0026rdquo;. I feel awful I missed that point since it is a very important one. I agree that 20% is much better than 10% and would ensure enough funding for all parties who get the block reward.\nDev Fund Supplemental Proposal: enforce devfund commitments with legal charter \u0026ldquo;This proposal does not address the merits, motivations or terms of any particular development funding proposal.\nThis proposal is supplemental to any Development Fund Proposal which requires or purports to require that the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and/or the Zcash Foundation (ZF) MUST or MUST NOT use development funds in particular ways or MUST or MUST NOT take other related off-chain actions (such requirements, Covenants).\nFor example, the proposal 20% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community-involved governance provides that “[f]unds accruing to the Zcash Development Fund MUST be used only for … technical work directly connected to the various software implementations of the Zcash protocol.” However, once development funding is approved and implemented via a hardfork, there will be no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the ZF and ECC abide by this requirement.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this adds too much legal overhead and fees on something that is less of a problem than it seems. At this time the ECC and Zcash Foundation are mostly trusted entities so we should prioritize if funding should occur and not how to enforce it legally.\nKek’s proposal: fund ECC for 2 more years \u0026ldquo;continue payouts at current % to ECC (not investors) for 2 extra years with option to vote on extending or ending contract after 2 years\ncontinued funding during these extra 2 years this is a way to kick the can down the road to allow the community to make more informed decisions that don’t feel rushed.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like this proposal because it leaves out the Zcash Foundation and other entities from receiving funding. Kicking the can down the road is not what the community wants as far as I can tell.\nDev Fund Proposal: Strategic Council Approach This proposal seems like a more mature and detailed version of the community involved \u0026ldquo;third party entity\u0026rdquo; mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity\u0026rdquo;. 20% of newly minted coins would be placed in a Developer Fund. \u0026ldquo;A five-person Strategic Council would be elected by the community every two years. The Strategic Council would determine the high-level strategy, goals, and metrics to evaluate progress for the ecosystem on a six-month cadence. The Strategic Council would be responsible for allocating funding to Executing Entities for the subsequent six months and summarizing the performance of Executing Entities in the prior six months.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Strategic Council would be paid for their work and seats on the council would not be permanent. This next part seems potentially troubling:\n\u0026ldquo;For the purposes of voting to determine seats (not having seats vote on issues): 1 of the 5 seats should be allocated for miners and signaled through nodes. 1 of the 5 should be ZEC holding weighted so 1 ZEC = 1 vote. 3 of the 5 should be 1 person = 1 vote.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like on-chain weighted votes based on ZEC as I mentioned at previous points in this article. In fact, most of the methods to determine who the seats should be are not fully fleshed out except the miner signaling one. The coin voting one doesn\u0026rsquo;t address all of the flaws coin voting can bring nor does it address how to perform a 1 person = 1 vote identity mechanic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen an argument that this system is structurally not very distinct from the Zcash Foundation\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and that their role can be modified to make them more in line with this proposal. At the same time, having a board that is connected to an entity asking for funding can be problematic and affect the accountability of deliverables as well as create biases on where funds should go.\nA Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal.) This looks like a really good proposal because it combines a few of the ideas from previous proposals (thus the name \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise\u0026rdquo;). 20% of the mining reward would be disbursed between the ECC (30%), the Zcash Foundation (30%), and as a restricted donation for the disbursement through ZF Grants (40%). Josh makes the point that the 2-of-3 multisig approach/third party approach would create a situation where:\n\u0026ldquo;either the ECC or the Zcash Foundation would spend a great deal of their time currying favor in either the process or selection of the party in question in the limited time between now and that party’s selection. Given that the Zcash Foundation is charged with representing community interests, I’m not sure why another community-focused representative would really make sense from the ECC’s perspective — they’d be constantly outvoted if interests clashed, so from a balance of power perspective I’m not sure why the ECC would find that tenable. And I’m not sure the community would want the “third party” to be another profit-generating enterprise, like a VC or another startup, which would tip power another way.\u0026rdquo;.\nI like the idea of a trust for carrying out the ZF Grants portion because it \u0026ldquo;reduce[es] complexity creep in consensus code. Rather than try to incorporate some complex mechanism for dev fund disbursements on-chain, we can meet the NU4 with the simplest possible code-change and spend more time ironing out the details of the trust “off-chain”\u0026rdquo;. The ZF Grant Review Committee makeup is also a good balance because it includes 1 seat for the ECC, 1 seat for the Zcash Foundation, 2 seats that are voted in, and 1 seat that is an elected technical member voted in by the other 4 seats. Additionally, there are a lot of requirements tied to all entities who receive funding from the developer fund.\nDev Fund Proposal: Carbon offsetting This proposal wants to reward a portion of the developer funding from other proposals towards the offsetting of carbon emissions via donations to carbon offsetting entities elected by the Zcash community. I like novel ideas that help with environmentalism, but at this stage in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s history I think figuring out how to sustain development should be a higher priority.\nDecentralizing the Dev Fee This proposal lays out some very detailed specifications that I really like. It would be a great proposal I would get behind if:\nThe price of ZEC was higher.\nZcash, both the technology and community, was more mature (meaning has existed for a longer amount of time in order to have more experience).\nThis proposal aims to take Zcash beyond just a Bitcoin clone with privacy by having robust ways to encourage outside development through the dev fund, among other goals they state in the \u0026ldquo;Requirements\u0026rdquo; section of their proposal. Here is how the dev fee is divided:\nThe Foundation shall receive 25% of the dev fee. The remaining 75% of the dev fee shall be distributed between development teams working to maintain clients. One third of the remaining fee (25% of the total) shall be reserved for the role of the “principal developer”, a developer with additional voice in Zcash governance. The remaining two thirds of the fee (50% of the total), called the “outside development fee”, shall be distributed between at least two development teams, chosen semi-annually by the Foundation, coinciding with network upgrades. The dev fee\u0026rsquo;s given to the Foundation and \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; are governed via a formula making sure they don\u0026rsquo;t receive too much money if the price of ZEC becomes very high. \u0026ldquo;Prior to each network upgrade, the Foundation shall recommend a list of addresses and a total number of ZEC per block each address is meant to receive from the dev fee. The recommendation will be “ratified” by the miners as the network upgrade activates.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;principal developer\u0026rdquo; is my main qualm. In the proposal Matt suggests ECC to be the principal developer. The role of the principal developer requires that they focus exclusively on Zcash research and development in exchange for the indefinite fee allocation. The ECC should be allowed to focus on whatever they want as a company because in the event Zcash is unprofitable via a variety of metrics the company could go under. Additionally, Zooko (CEO of the ECC) recently posted a response on the thread saying:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m really not sure if ECC would apply for the job of Principal Developer in this scenario. We will serve Zcash however we are needed, provided that we could be effective. However, I’m not sure we could be effective in the role of Principal Developer as described here.\nSo if this ZIP were the community’s choice, ECC would support it, in cooperation with Zfnd, with software and with the trademark, as we’ve consistently pledged to do, but we might not apply for the role of Principal Developer\u0026hellip;\nAt the coin price of $40, the Principal Developer would have only $219k/mo to do their work, and they would be prohibited from seeking external funding.\u0026rdquo;\nIf I was in Zooko\u0026rsquo;s position I would do the exact same thing.\nThere are other parts of the proposal such as the requirement of bi-weekly dev call for all dev fee recipients and its innovative ways for solving the \u0026ldquo;crowding out\u0026rdquo; problem, even if they do not work in Zcash\u0026rsquo;s case. If Zcash were more mature and had another candidate as well qualified as the ECC to be a principal developer candidate I may have a different opinion on this proposal, but if the ECC is out of the running for the Principal Developer position this proposal is a no-go.\nDev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants This proposal is a fork of \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo;. It is 20% of block rewards split into 3 parts:\n35% for the Electric Coin Company\n25% for Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants)\n40% for additional “Major Grants” for large-scale long-term projects (decided by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and copy/paste the differences between Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposaland this one as listed in the proposal:\nThe Dev Fund slice intended for external recipients (beyond ECC, Zfnd and existing Zfnd grants) may be used to fund ECC if no competitive alternatives present themselves, to mitigate unwarranted loss of existing capabilities.\nFor simplicity, the above slice is combined with the Foundation’s existing grant system; but is accompanied by explicit requirements to achieve its goals, independent advisory input, and a Restricted Funds mechanism to enforce these requirements.\nThe “easing function” coin value cap is removed, in favor of capping each slice at $700k/month funding target. Any excess is kept in a reserve, from which it can be withdrawn only to maintain the funding target in the future.\nStrengthened the transparency and accountability requirements, and harmonized them across ECC, Zfnd and major grantees.\nRemoved Zfnd’s supervisory role in determining the “principal developer”, fixing it to be ECC (changing this would be sufficiently dramatic to merit a fork).\nSmall differences in prescribed changes to the Zfnd board.\nCall for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance.\nClarity and brevity.\nI like this proposal more than Matt\u0026rsquo;s and I agree it is an improvement. I would imagine that this may be more palatable to Zooko since the ECC would get more money and be getting guaranteed money.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Volatility Reserve\u0026rdquo; is a great idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Each Dev Fund slice has a Funding Target, initially US $700,000 for each slice. At the end of each calendar month, the fair market value of the Dev Fund ZEC received during that month will be computed, and the excess over the Funding Target will be put into a dedicated Volatility Reserve account by the funds’ recipient.\u0026rdquo;\nThe transparency and accountability are similar to Matt\u0026rsquo;s proposal which I find acceptable, although it may be a little hard to define some of the broader terms such as \u0026ldquo;major activity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;detailed review\u0026rdquo;. Not a huge issue though.\nEDIT 11/18: ZIP: “Keep It Simple, Zcashers (KISZ): 10% to ECC, 10% to ZFnd” This was a last minute proposal that gave 10% of the 20% dev fund block reward to the ECC and the other 10% to the Zcash Foundation. It is very simple (as described in the title) which is nice, but it kicks the can down the road with regards to direct community involvement in how the funds are managed, which I believe is important for a large portion of the Zcash community.\nMy Perspective After reading through all the proposals I have decided which one I will be voting on in the Community Advisory Panel poll.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always in favor of pragmatism over dogmatism. That shapes many of my final opinions after viewing all the official proposals. The reality is that without some sort of funding for major Zcash entities such as the ECC and the Zcash Foundation, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a bright future for Zcash. As Josh Cincinnati puts it in his proposal \u0026ldquo;A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;The fundamental assumption is that Zcash won’t thrive without a dev fund. I wish this wasn’t true (I really do), and for the longest time I was against the idea. But I’ve come to fear the alternative without one; I fear the privacy technology pioneered by Zcash may never reach its true potential — not just for our community, but for others interested in novel approaches to private money.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore people say \u0026ldquo;This gives the ECC and Zcash Foundation too much power\u0026rdquo; we need to understand that right now there are only 2 major entities heavily supporting Zcash in the ecosystem because Parity is no longer working on Zebra (the Zcash Foundation is). Most of these proposals would be garbage if any entity other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation were as trustworthy by community standards. Realistically the ECC and Zcash Foundation will be the main 2 entities receiving funds from the proposed Zcash Developer Fund in all of these proposals and that is okay.\nThis reminds me a lot of the choice the Ethereum community had to make during The DAO hack hard fork in 2016 that caused a chain split creating Ethereum Classic. You can read about the DAO hack in this article. Back then Ethereum was young. Many of us came into the Ethereum community following the ideals of immutability at all costs to protect against government censorship and other threats. Then a very large portion of the community’s funds were put at risk and a decision had to be made. Do we stick to our dogma and let the attacker keep the funds or should we be pragmatic and think about the future?\nThe future could be grim for Ethereum if we let the attacker keep the funds. I think it would have made a lot of community members who lost their investment leave and marred Ethereum as a failed project with most of the ether in circulation at that time going to an unknown bad actor. I think the Ethereum community made the correct decision by choosing pragmatism over \u0026ldquo;code is law\u0026rdquo;. Promises should be able to be broken when the fate of the project itself hangs in the balance. In the case of Zcash I hope the Zcash community chooses pragmatism and chooses a proposal that allows for funding entities helping build and support Zcash in these early days.\nMy Dev Fund Proposal Picks Here are my top 3 proposals. I will be voting for #1 but want to include #2 and #3 in case you are an Advisory Board member and want other options.\nEDIT 11/18: Here is what I decided to do: rather than picking my top 3 choices, I am eliminating the #2 and #3 choices for simplicity and only including my top choice (it has not changed, but there is additional reasoning).\n#1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)**\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nSo what makes this proposal better than all of the rest? I feel like it strikes a balance between simply giving 10% each to two organizations and pleasing those in the community who want a more specific say in how things happen. The largest piece (40%) of the dev fund would go \u0026ldquo;to the fund [of] the Zcash Foundation as a RESTRICTED donation purely for disbursement through ZF Grants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Zcash wants anyone else leaving the community due to disagreements and this proposal gives power to the community by making an \u0026ldquo;independent body to both organizations\u0026rdquo; that can choose to donate to those who most need it.\nEDIT 11/18: A note on ECC\u0026rsquo;s Funding from my perspective I know there is a lot of fear about the ECC having to wind down if their budget is not met. That is a real concern. The fact that they now have around 30 employees and their quarterly cost (as described in the Q3 2019 transparency report) is well under $1m is really astounding for the level of expertise they have on their team. It would be prudent to donate some of the ZF Grants funds to the ECC in addition to the 30% of the dev fund that the ECC will already receive under this plan. It is important to keep the ECC afloat. It really hurt me to choose a proposal that would potentially put the future of the ECC in jeopardy, but I wanted my choice, above all else, to be reflective of what I felt was best for Zcash according to what the Zcash community wanted and that reflected the values of Zcash.\nConclusion Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to the Zcash Foundation Advisory Board Members who read this and consider the proposals carefully.\nEDIT 11/18: My original ordering for propsals is below.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #1: A Grand Compromise/Synthesis ZIP Proposal by Josh Cincinnati (Note: The page this is linked to is Josh\u0026rsquo;s latest revision to the proposal)\nThis proposal is the most pragmatic in my mind. It gets straight to the point: the ECC and Zcash Foundation are best suited to manage this level of funding, but we still need a third entity/group to keep things in check. The community is still close-knit enough that it would be easier for the major orgs to find community members to fit the ZF Grant Review Committee than to start a third-party entity from scratch or make it more complicated than it has to be.\nI highly doubt an organization as well trusted and suitable for managing a large development fund as the Zcash Foundation and the ECC is will form in the next 2 years. Splitting the fund between those two entities would probably happen anyway so why be overzealous in making things compeltely fair and unbiased and perfectly decentralized this early in the game.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #2: Blocktown Development Fund Proposal: 10% to a 2-of-3 multisig with community involved Third Entity by Blocktown, James Todaro, and Joseph Todaro\nAs I said in my #1 choice, this proposal realizes the fact that the Zcash Foundation and the ECC are best suited for managing this funding. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t use on-chain voting mechanisms that would complicate things and leaves the decision on how to create the third-party entity open. I believe that the community could come up with a third-party entity proposal in a matter of months, but that still provides a lot of headaches and potentially a second poll so for that reason it isn\u0026rsquo;t my #1 choice.\nNOTE: OLD ORDER - #3: Dev Fund Proposal: Dev Fund to ECC + Zfnd + Major Grants by Eran Tromer\nA lot of the issues I had with the \u0026ldquo;Decentralizing the Dev Fee\u0026rdquo; proposal are fixed in this one. It seems to be a good balance of concerns and takes into account different party’s incentives to participate, including the ECC.\nEDIT 11/18: I originally said, \u0026ldquo;The reason it doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Blocktown\u0026rsquo;s proposal is because I am not sure the exclusivity clause for the principal developer would work for the ECC as they may want the flexibility to mature into an organization beyond specifically Zcash.\u0026rdquo; This statement was inaccurate as there is no \u0026ldquo;exclusivity clause\u0026rdquo; in this proposal.\nThe \u0026ldquo;strengthened\u0026rdquo; transparency and accountability requirements, while solid, may be a bit too much for organizations and individuals to keep up with and cause some pressure and inflexibility on the part of the Zcash Foundation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-15-hudsons-zcash-developer-fund-proposal-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent the last two days going over every dev fund proposal and writing my thoughts.

I have adjusted my medications and went through an experimental bi-polar/depression treatment in July called intravenous ketamine treatment. Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has been used for since the 1960s as a pain reliever and sedative. Only recently has it been explored as a treatment for drug resistant depression, bipolar, chronic pain, and other things. My experience with the drug was very positive. After my first infusion I noticed an immediate difference. My depression was significantly lower. One interesting side effect was that my anxiety increased as my depression decreased. It is almost like the depressive part of my mental health was masking the severe anxiety side of it. This effect mostly went away as I continued treatment. I had six ketamine infusions over the course of about 3 weeks, steadily increasing my dosage with each infusion. Professional anesthesiologists administered the drug and monitored me so I felt safe.\nNow for the downsides. It is EXPENSIVE. Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a \u0026ldquo;booster\u0026rdquo; ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain. If you have any questions about the specifics of my treatment or want advice in this area please message me (see the Contact page).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-mental-health-update-october-2019/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMental health update: I am doing a lot better.

In order to combat the stigma I want to explain my personal struggle with it and encourage others to seek help.\nTrigger warning: discussion of depression, anxiety, and suicide.\nI suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar II disorder. It has taken my entire life to be properly diagnosed since many of these types of mental illnesses are connected. As a child I remember always being anxious about everything and experiencing huge signs of OCD, including moving the pots and pans in the cabinet to an exact placement and feeling like my mother would die if I didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust the doorway exactly four times every night before I went to sleep. As I grew older I figured out ways to work through my OCD symptoms, but even today I still get these feelings that things need to be moved or touched or ordered a certain way or else bad things will happen.\nI was diagnosed with depression in college when classes became very stressful and I started to have suicidal ideation. My ideation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally center around the actual true desire to kill myself, but rather the concepts of suicide and obsession over the planning. I would get these intrusive thoughts that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off that revolved the letters I would write, how I would leave my assets and cryptocurrency to Laura, what order I would publish my messages on social media, etc. I found out later that this is likely is connected to my OCD.\nDuring my first job at USAA, I casually explained these intrusive thoughts to my manager. I was so used to these ideations by this point that the conversation was eerily nonchalant. The next day I was called into the HR office where they took away my badge and work laptop. I freaked out because work was my life and I thought they were firing me. They told me about how they cared about my mental health and were forcing me to take time off to seek medical professionals. During the leave, USAA paid me without me having to take any personal days. I am so grateful they did this because it allowed me to take time to get on track to finding the right therapist and psychologist without worrying about money.\nUnfortunately the chemical imbalances I have in my brain mean that I have to constantly work towards controlling the symptoms of bipolar II. I get so much work done during my manic times and can\u0026rsquo;t leave bed during depressive episodes. This morning I cried because for the first time in a long time I was having suicidal ideation again I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. I felt like a failure that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the thoughts go away. I have a wonderful spouse and great therapist who talked me through things and I am doing better, but days like this are really difficult.\nOver the past few years I have visited multiple therapists/psychiatrists and been on over a dozen different combinations of medications. It is a hard and painful process to cycle through different people and medicines looking for answers and relief. However, once you find the right combination of healthcare providers that understand you and prescribe you the right medication it makes a world of difference. What I have cannot be cured, but it can be managed with work and support of those around me. I am thankful to have a spouse, friends, and co-workers who care about me and support me when I am at low points in my mental illness. My wife Laura has been my biggest support and I love her so much.\nIf you are reading this and think you may suffer from a mental illness know that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight it alone and there are many paths you can take to control the symptoms. It is very freeing to talk to people you trust about it and start to find solutions. Therapy and medications have helped me tremendously, but it is different for different people.

It is the largest tabletop-game convention in North America (70,000+ people). I normally have Ethereum and other blockchain related things consume my life, but a few days a week I meet with friends and play tabletop-RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons (5e), 7th Sea, Deadlands, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. This blog entry primarily describes the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the folks at the One Shot Podcast Network and how I plan to apply that to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It also describes a way that blockchain technology can help content creators who utilize traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nOne Shot Podcast Network Background During the convention, my group attended a number of panels run by members of the One Shot Podcast Network. It is hard to pin down a single sentence definition of what the network is because it\u0026rsquo;s collection of shows are fairly diverse. Some of the podcasts are traditional podcast style where there is a group of people talking about a topic and others are \u0026ldquo;actual play\u0026rdquo; where the participants play a tabletop-RPG and lead the listeners through their story. The One Shot Podcast Network supports a variety of nerdy podcasts such as:\nOne Shot - Every month a rotating group of players are led on a \u0026ldquo;one shot adventure\u0026rdquo; where a new, short role playing game is tried. The games vary widely, but my favorite episodes are the comedic ones such as Inspectres. Campaign - Campaign focuses on long-form or “campaign” gaming with a team of improvisers. It is currently set in the Star Wars universe, and uses the Edge of the Empire gaming system. It has a good mix of comedy and drama elements that shows how character-driven storytelling can create a compelling and entertaining narrative. Never Tell Me The Pods - This podcast focuses on discussing Star Wars fandom and lore with guests from around the Star Wars universe. This demonstrates one of the podcasts One Shot produces that focuses on a specific topic that panelists deep-dive into. Adventure - This is an actual play podcast that brings your favorite stories and characters to life, combining fanfiction and tabletop games. Some of the types of fanfiction covered include Pokémon, Harry Potter, and The Magic School Bus. What I experienced at Gencon I want to jump straight to the point. The ecosystem that the One Shot Podcast Network built is incredible. The hosts of the podcasts participated in a variety of panels covering topics including how to podcast an actual play game and an in-depth discussion of comedy vs drama in RPGs. The days of smaller panels culminated into the annual One Shot network panel where most of the One Shot Network hosts discussed their accomplishments and goofed off. In every panel I saw how at ease the One Shot hosts were to each other and fans. They hosted a meetup where over 75 people showed up to talk to their favorite podcast hosts and meet others in their niche community. Many of the people who contribute their time to host and create these podcasts have full time jobs and do this in their free time. They clearly loved what they were doing and showed legitimate appreciation for their fans. Their accomplishments, including about adding new shows and being able to start regularly paying the hosts, showed growth and success.\nHow I am applying things I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced to my blockchain life I did not expect to be able to take things from Gencon and apply them to the blockchain related parts of my life. I frequent the Ethereum subreddit and other channels to help in community building and communication. The Ethereum blockchain community is very tech dense and there is often a lack of good communication between the creators of the software and applications and the consumers of the software. Getting a glimpse of how a podcast network community functions gave me ideas on how to disintermediate the services that these types of businesses rely on and how the Ethereum community can be improved.\nKindness and availability I am incredibly biased, but I feel that Ethereum is one of the easier blockchain communities to join. However, this quality of inclusion is declining. It is in part due to the community growing faster than anticipated. A gap exists between those early Ethereum adopters and newcomers. The early Ethereum people are working on distributed apps (Dapps) and the protocol so they no longer have the time to on-board the new Ethereum users. Even if people haven\u0026rsquo;t changed their personalities there is less of that community oriented feeling because the popularity of Ethereum is keeping many early adopters busy (including myself). The One Shot panels reminded me of the early Ethereum days because they still have time to talk to every fan that comes up and all of the hosts had a solid perception on \u0026ldquo;the real world\u0026rdquo;. In Ethereum many of the early adopters have come into a lot of money, drowned themselves in work until they burned out, or put themselves on a pedestal. At the core of all of this is a need for kindness and availability. Someone who wonders into the Ethereum community should be treated with kindness and patience even if they know next to nothing about blockchain. We need to build tools to facilitate the non-technical processes involved in on-boarding and welcoming people to our community. It is hard to get back to how things were when Ethereum was smaller, but effort can be made to make processes and tools to facilitate newcomers and give them some availability in our busy schedules. We have some tools, like Ethereum StackExchange, that need love and can help with newcomer technical questions.\nDecentralizing Patreon and Kickstarter Networks like One Shot primarily receive funding from the following sources:\nadvertising merchandise sales Kickstarter Pateron Podcast networks are not really money making ventures. They are done for the love of it. One of the major ways to generate recurring revenue for podcasts is through crowdfunding. The gist of both Kickstarter and Patreon is to raise money for a product or service. In the case of One Shot, they have ran a Kickstarter Project to fund \u0026ldquo;Dungeon Dome\u0026rdquo;, a new podcast show on the network where the Kickstarter participants help craft the characters and antics on the show. Patreon is a site where users get access to exclusive content and other perks for monthly donation subscriptions. Both Kickstarter and Patreon take a sizeable percentage from the content/product creators and there are fees associated with using PayPal, credit cards, or other traditional payment rails. Blockchain technology can help alleviate some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.\nWhy should Kickstarter/Patreon users use blockchain? Blockchain technologies such as Ethereum offer a cheaper, more personalized crowdfunding experience. Recently ICOs have been the craze in the cryptocurrency space. This is when businesses raise money in an unregulated fashion using cryptocurrency and software like Ethereum to generate custom \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; that represent an asset or utility in their system. For example, Golem had a crowdsale to buy GNT tokens that could be used to rent part of the Golem supercomputer processing power after it launches. Users will have to pay GNT tokens to reserve computing power to run their graphics processing programs. Their crowdsale raised about $9 million USD in 20 minutes. Other recent crowdsale have raised $100 million and even $200 million USD. I think that most of these projects are irresponsible for raising money in this way because it is risky from a regulatory perspective and having that much money only complicates things when the project is small.\nHow to do it Despite everything I said above I think the token crowdsale model can be adjusted for groups like the One Shot Podcast Network to raise a reasonable amount of money and get their fan base hyped up. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to expand on all the details in this blog, but here is the summary of what a podcast network could do:\nA crowdfund would happen to generate \u0026ldquo;POD\u0026rdquo; tokens The POD tokens can be purchased by exchanging cryptocurrency (there would be work done to make this frictionless to the average podcast listener). The tokens would have an equivalent USD value, such as 1 POD token being equal to $1 USD. Fans of the show can exchange USD (through the form of a cryptocurrency, once again seamlessly exchanged) for PODs and then use the PODs for perks such as premium content, t-shirts, raffles, etc. This scenario creates a few perks:\nNo more Patreon/Kickstarter fees Content creators can customize the token and what perks the token can grant Fans can easily transfer the tokens between each other if they are a part of a forum or community that can \u0026ldquo;tip\u0026rdquo; each other. This concept is similar to Reddit Gold. Using a bleeding edge technology such as Ethereum earns press and opens your community to a new class of users who would not have stumbled across the podcast otherwise. I am aware that this sounds exactly like how Kickstarter and Patreon work today, but the major difference is that you are cutting out the middle-man. Using this model you no longer have to pay fees to Patreon or Kickstarter. Additionally, the tokens can be used as a way to build social reputation amongst community members who help fund your project. For the user tokens can be a cheaper way (compared to PayPal) to send donation funds or gift those funds to friends in the form of tokens.\nConclusion I bet that someone is already working on decentralizing Patreon/Kickstarter and if you know about them leave a comment so I can amend this blog post. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments and ways for content creators to cultivate close knit communities. I hope that content creators start to utilize this technology and ultimately make platforms like Patreon obsolete. It should be noted that the scenario I described above may have legal and regulatory risks and I am not a lawyer or even play one on TV. I want to thank the One Shot Podcast Network and all of the people I met this weekend involved in it. It is really cool to see how other communities operate. A lot of the time people in blockchain communities get so entrenched in the technology that they never leave their rooms and experience new people and new things. That is a bad thing and people should discover new experiences so they can craft new perspectives and bring them back to their communities.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-21-gencon-blockchains-one-shot-podcast-network/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend I attended my first \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Con\"\u003eGencon gaming convention\u003c/a\u003e.

This blog post is to explain their projects and state why I’m agreeing to advise them.\nStatus.im What is it? Status is a mobile Ethereum OS that manifest itself as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It is a gateway to access Ethereum Dapps (decentralized applications) on a smartphone, an encrypted message service, and is attempting to build a network of community powered services as part of the \u0026ldquo;Status Network\u0026rdquo;. Status recently held a token distribution for the \u0026ldquo;Status Network Token (SNT)\u0026rdquo;. SNT tokens are used as a utility to power the Status client with services including governance of the Status client, participation in a Fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’, A Decentralized Push Notification Market, and more. Click here for a blog that explains their vision.\nWhy I Am Advising Them The Status co-founders have been active participants in the Ethereum community for a long time. They have consistently been very transparent of their product and its history and struggles. Status has pivoted several times on an ideation and software level. That is to be expected of a project that took the risk of dreaming big back in 2015 when Ethereum was in its infancy. Just looking at Jarrad\u0026rsquo;s On a technical level Status was one of the earliest projects to integrate a geth light client and is one of the only projects currently using the Whisper communication protocol to handle in app encrypted messaging. If you browse their Github you see a history of contributions and innovative projects that were well ahead of their time (check out syng client). I have known co-founders Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts for a long time and have complete trust in their integrity as people and love for this community. When looking at projects in this space, a solid team is one of the top two things to look for. A groundbreaking idea is great, but execution of the idea is much more important. A solid team is needed to execute and I have little doubt that the team at Status can and will execute their vision.\nSmartContract.com What is it? When you first hear about blockchains you get to a point in your understanding of the concepts where you question how useful this technology can be if it is completely walled off to the outside world. Secure data feeds (sometimes called oracles) between the real world and a blockchain aim to solve this. Trusted data feeds provide information like sports scores, stock prices, and generic API calls to a blockchain. This can help provide more useful real world use cases that rely on information that is only available outside of a blockchain, like if you want to trigger a blockchain event the next time the Cubs win the World Series. Implementing a secure way to do this is super hard. I mean very hard. There are multiple places along the path for data from a feed to be manipulated, maliciously or not, and pushed to the blockchain permanently.\nThe SmartContract.com team has been working since 2014 to tackle these problems. They have a product called ChainLink that allows you to connect your smart contract to a data feed from any web API and some payment networks. They recently partnered with Cornell\u0026rsquo;s IC3 organization to help launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data. This helps solve some of the issues around data tampering when using unsecure hardware. They are developing a decentralized oracle blockchain middleware called the \u0026ldquo;LINK network\u0026rdquo; that allows anyone to become a provider of external data. These utility tokens will allow you to monetize the data you are sending to smart contracts and get paid in LINK tokens. They are currently in the pre-sale phase of their token sale for LINK tokens.\nWhy I Am Advising Them I am in love with the use case they are tackling. I think it is incredibly important to have a secure service for trusted data feeds. It will enable so many use cases that are currently being stifled by the necessity of blockchains being closed systems. I only recently met the SmartContract.com team, but so far I have had good interactions with them. They have been working on this problem since before Ethereum was even a thing and I believe they have the most experience tackling this problem. They have a working data feed product today that anyone can try called ChainLink. The astounding thing is that it is designed to work on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. Not many blockchain companies are targeting the 3 most popular blockchains. Click here for an example of a data feed from ChainLink that pushes the Ethereum price in USD.\nConclusion As you have seen in my explanations, my main reasons for advising any group is because I believe in the team and the idea. These two companies meet my requirements which are as follows:\nHave a team that can execute an idea. If they have a token, it must be a utility token with a purpose and not a security. Their idea or product must be useful at least and innovative at best. These requirements do not mean I will advise your project. Status and SmartContract.com are the only companies I am publicly and officially advising. I do not plan to pick up anymore advisory roles in the near future. I have an IoT/blockchain security start-up called Oaken Innovations that is gaining a lot of traction that I dedicate my time to.\nThere is a lot of money and ideas being thrown around in the blockchain space. Be cautious of any token sales or promises that blockchain start-ups make. Watch for a team with actual code, a working prototype, and a solid team. Those are the groups you want to associate with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-08-06-advising-status-smartcontract/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was inspired by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zooko/\"\u003eZooko Wilcox\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e blog posts that detail why he is advising \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-the-basic-attention-token-bat-team-7ac47d70da02\"\u003eBasic Attention Token (BAT)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@zooko/why-im-advising-tezos-a8e04ec1d0d4\"\u003eTezos\u003c/a\u003e to write a post on my official advising roles in the blockchain community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have agreed to serve as an advisor to the Status team and SmartContract.com team.

Corrections are welcome :)\nWhat are accounts? EOA vs contract accounts There are two types of accounts in Ethereum\nExternally Owned Accounts Contracts Accounts This distinction will be abstracted in the upcoming Metropolis upgrade.\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) An externally controlled account\nhas an ether balance, can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code), is controlled by private keys, has no associated code. Contract accounts A contract\nhas an ether balance, has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from other contracts. when executed - perform operations of arbitrary complexity (Turing completeness) - manipulate its own persistent storage, i.e. can have its own permanent state - can call other contracts All action on the Ethereum block chain is set in motion by transactions fired from accounts. Every time a contract account receives a transaction, its code is executed as instructed by the input parameters sent as part of the transaction. The contract code is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each node participating in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.\nWhat are transactions and messages? Transactions The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.\nTransactions contain:\nthe recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message via the blockchain to the recipient, VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient, an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract, a GASLIMIT value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take, a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instruction, i.e. a computational step. Messages Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as function calls.\nA message contains:\nthe sender of the message (implicit). the recipient of the message VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address, an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract a GASLIMIT value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Messages are also sometimes called \u0026ldquo;internal transactions.\u0026rdquo; Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can. Many times people use the term transaction when they are referring to a message, so it is possible that this term is being phased out via community consensus by not using it.\nWhat is gas? Ethereum implements an execution environment on the blockchain called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node participating in the network runs the EVM as part of the block verification protocol. They go through the transactions listed in the block they are verifying and run the code as triggered by the transaction within the EVM. Each and every full node in the network does the same calculations and stores the same values. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done offchain. For every executed operation there is a specified cost, expressed in a number of gas units. Every operation that a contract is able to take advantage of has an associated gas value. Here is an outdated list of gas costs per operation code (opcode).\nGas and transaction costs Every transaction is required to include a gas limit (sometimes called startGas) and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas. Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. In reality, today all transactions are picked up by miners eventually, but the amount of transaction fees that a user chooses to send affects how long it will take until the transaction is mined. If the total amount of gas used by the computational steps spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction is processed. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. The blockchain shows that a transaction was attempted, but it did not provide enough gas and all contract operations were reverted. All excess gas not used by the transaction execution is reimbursed to the sender as Ether. Because gas cost estimates are only approximate, many users overpay in gas to guarantee that their transaction is accepted. This is okay because any excess gas is refunded to you.\nEstimating transaction costs The total ether cost of a transaction is based on 2 factors:\ngasUsed: the total gas that is consumed by the transaction\ngasPrice: price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction\nTotal cost = gasUsed * gasPrice\ngasUsed Each operation in the EVM was assigned a number of how much gas it consumes. gasUsed is the sum of all the gas for all the operations executed.\nFor estimating gasUsed, there is an estimateGas API that can be used but has some caveats.\ngasPrice A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user may specify whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero. However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei. As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.\nExample transaction cost With permission, I am borrowing this example and analogy from the awesome MyEtherWallet team. Please visit their well-written guide on gas here. They also have an excellent utilities page that allows you to convert amounts of ether into subunits.\nYou can think of the gas limit like the amount of liters/gallons/units of gas for a car. You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.\nWith a car, it\u0026rsquo;s $2.50 (price) per gallon (unit). With Ethereum, it\u0026rsquo;s 20 GWEI (price) per gas (unit). To fill up your \u0026ldquo;tank\u0026rdquo;, it takes\u0026hellip; - 10 gallons at $2.50 = $25 - 21000 units of gas at 20 GWEI = 0.00042 ETH.\nTherefore, the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether.\nSending tokens will typically take ~50000 gas to ~100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;block gas limit\u0026rdquo;? Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have 5 transactions where each transaction has a gas limit of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If the block gas limit is 100, then the first four transactions can fit in the block. Miners decide which transactions to include in a block. A different miner could try including the last 2 transactions in the block (50+40), and they only have space to include the first transaction (10). If you try to include a transaction that uses more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network and your Ethereum client will give you the message \u0026ldquo;Transaction exceeds block gas limit\u0026rdquo;. Credit for this example comes from this Ethereum StackExchange post by \u0026ldquo;ethers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe block gas limit is currently 4,712,357 gas at the time of writing according to ethstats.net, meaning around 224 transactions that each have a transaction gas limit of 21000 can fit in 1 block (which is produced every 15-20 seconds on average). The protocol allows the miner of a block to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction.\nWho decides what the block gas limit is? Miners on the network decide what the block gas limit is. Separate from the adjustable protocol block gas limit is a default mining strategy of a minimum block gas limit of 4,712,388 for most clients. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\nHow is the block gas limit changed? Miners on Ethereum use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a geth or Parity Ethereum client node. geth and Parity have options that miners are able to change. geth\u0026rsquo;s command line options for mining are list here and Parity\u0026rsquo;s options are here.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network? Recently there have been many comments about the Ethereum network slowing down, becoming clogged, or becoming unusable. These comments describe this slow-down as a \u0026ldquo;DoS\u0026rdquo; of the Ethereum network. A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network. Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be malicious or non-malicious.\nMalicious DoS Last fall Ethereum was attacked by a person or group in what was called a transaction spam attack. The attack is described in this blog post:\nThe attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network.\nDuring the attack miners were asked to lower the block gas limit to 1.5 million and then to 2 million in another instance. There have been other instances where there has been requests for the miners to lower the block gas limit during attacks on the network.\nNon-Malicious DoS Non-malicious DoS incidents are simply when the network has so many pending transactions that it takes an unusually long time to process a transaction. Recently the popularity and proliferation of token distribution events (or initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales) have caused the network to become backed up with transactions. The folks at Infura wrote a blog about the technical details.\nWhy is the block gas limit not changing even when blocks are full? Primary Reason: Miners are not using the adaptive gas limit feature.\nThe Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit, and so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. Originally, this mechanism was coupled with a default strategy where miners would vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million, but which would target 150% of the recent (1024-block exponential moving) average gas used if that amount is higher, allowing capacity to organically increase with growing demand while still including a ceiling for anti-spam purposes.\nAs described in the \u0026ldquo;Malicious DoS\u0026rdquo; section above there were multiple times in the past where miners were suggested to change their settings to set the block gas limit to non-default settings to help deter attacks until fixes were developed. The problem is that some mining pools never changed the settings back even after the attacks subsided. About a month ago miners were asked to change the gas limit and gas price settings to re-introduce an adaptive gas limit feature because the recent token sales were quickly filling blocks and causing blockchain transaction congestion.\nETH Gas Station is an excellent resource for people looking for the latest information on what block gas limits mining pools are voting for.\nWhat do miners need to do to fix this? Miners can adjust their settings on their geth or Parity client to re-enable adaptive gas limits. Note: The values below are taken from this Reddit post and can actually be set much higher, as explained in this Reddit post.\nGeth Suggested setting --gasprice 4000000000 --targetgaslimit 4712388\rExplanation --targetgaslimit Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: \u0026ldquo;4712388\u0026rdquo;) --gasprice Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transactions (default: \u0026ldquo;20000000000\u0026rdquo;).
