Most ketamine clinics recommended that you go through 6 infusions depending on how you respond to the treatment and each infusion costs $500 (so $3000 total for the entire treatment). Intravenous ketamine treatment isn’t approved by the FDA because research is still being done so it is not covered by insurance except in very rare cases, so I paid entirely out of pocket. Ketamine is also a street drug so getting research on the effects of ketamine treatment in a controlled setting has been difficult. Good news: There is a recently approved treatment that is very similar to ketamine that is sprayed up your nose called Spravato. I haven’t tried Spravato, but I may. It is covered by insurance normally and administered in a medical office under supervision. The recommendation is that you get a “booster” ketamine infusion 1-6 months after your initial treatment ends whenever you feel like the effects are wearing off. It has been roughly 3 months for me and I am considering going in for my booster in the next week as I’ve noticed I am getting into a depressive episode that is not subsiding. Another downside is that everyone’s chemistry is different so it has varying degrees of effectiveness depending on who you are. For many people, therapy, medication, and self-care are enough to help manage mental health issues like depression.\nAfter trying different medications for over 7 years with varying degrees of success, I decided to go with ketamine infusions and I am happy I did. It changed my life. Here is a link with some more information on how ketamine affects the brain.
